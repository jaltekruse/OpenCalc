OpenCalc has been updated to run through JNLP. As long as you have JAVA installed, the file named OpenCalc.jnlp will download and launch the latest version. If you are not connected to the Internet it will use the last version that it downloaded, which is automatically saved to your computer. Running it the first time will require an Internet connection.

The interface has been recently updated and is hopefully fairly straightforward. Any suggestions are more than welcome, and can be submitted to the forum at our homepage. www.sourceforge.net/projects/opencalc.

1. General Use
The calculator functions much the same as many similar products. The input box below the large white panel is used to type calculations. When you want to evaluate an expression you can type enter, or hit the solve button.

2.Variable Usage
If you wish to store a value for recall later you can use the "=" operator. This is used for assignment using the format: "variableName = 5" or "variableName = (7*8)^3". The variable name must come first. You will then see in the above box a history of everything that you have typed.

3.Creating variables
You can use any of the existing variables available in the Vars tab, or type your own variable names into the terminal to create them. They must begin with an underscore or a letter, and all of the subsequent characters can be numbers, letters or underscores. Variable names are case sensitive.

Examples of correct names: x, x2, size, speed, Time, _val, num_of_marbles
Examples of incorrect names: 2x, 

To recall a previous entry you can use the up/down arrows on your keyboard. Keep in mind that the list does not loop. Once you hit the first entry it will stop.
